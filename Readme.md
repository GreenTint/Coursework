# Networks and Systems Security – Portfolio of Practical Work

This repository contains my weekly practical work for the Networks and Systems Security module.  
Each week includes the required scripts, outputs, and a short reflection summarising what I completed and learned.

---

## 📁 Week 01–02 — Career Path & Skills Gap Analysis
- `seminar.txt` includes my job role analysis, company fit summaries and skills gap table.
- Reflection:
  > This week I analysed my target career path, compared job roles, carried out a skills gap analysis, and reflected on the steps I need to take to prepare for a data-related career.

---

## 📁 Week 03 — Authentication & Access Control
Files:
- `password_strength.py`
- `hashing_demo.py`
- `salt_pepper_demo.py`
- `totp_test.py`
- `bruteforce_simulation.py`
- `auth_system.py`

Reflection:
> In this seminar I implemented password strength checking, hashing with bcrypt, salting and peppering, 2FA using TOTP, and a brute-force demonstration to understand secure authentication principles.

---

## 📁 Week 04 — Malware & Detection
Files:
- `file_integrity.py`
- `detect_changes.py`
- `signature_scanner.py`
- `worm_sim.py`
- `monitoring_prototype.py`

Reflection:
> This week I simulated malware analysis tasks including file hashing, detecting file tampering, scanning for signatures, modelling worm propagation, and designing basic defensive monitoring.

---

## 📁 Week 05 — Web Application Security
Files:
- `wapiti_scan_output.html` (or folder)
- `wapiti_runner.py`

Reflection:
> I installed and used Wapiti to scan an approved vulnerable web app, reviewed the findings, and learned how automated scanners detect web vulnerabilities and their limitations.

---

## 📁 Week 06 — Static Malware Analysis (PE / YARA)
Files:
- `hashes.py`
- `strings.py`
- `pe_analysis.py`
- `yara_test.py`
- `full_static_triage.py`

Reflection:
> This week I performed static analysis on a safe executable, computing hashes, extracting strings, inspecting the PE header, analysing imports, and applying YARA rules to understand malware triage workflows.

---

## 📁 Week 07 — Penetration Testing
Files:
- `domain_lookup.py`
- `blackbox_headers.py`
- `port_scanner.py`
- `nmap_scan.py`

Reflection:
> I carried out ethical penetration testing tasks in a controlled environment, including passive reconnaissance, HTTP header inspection, manual port scanning, and Nmap-based service detection.

---

## 📁 Week 08 — Assessment Feedback Session
Reflection:
> I reviewed the marking criteria, checked the structure of my portfolio, and ensured my weekly documentation meets First-class expectations with clear organisation and reflections.

---

## 📁 Week 09 — GenAI Security & LLM Red Teaming
Files:
- `ollama_test.py`
- `prompt_injection.py`
- `data_poisoning.py`
- `inversion_test.py`
- `extraction_test.py`

Reflection:
> I deployed a local LLM with Ollama and tested it for prompt injection, data poisoning, model inversion, and model extraction behaviours, gaining insight into generative AI threat models and mitigations.

# ✔ How to Navigate the Portfolio
Each week folder contains:
- The Python scripts written in the seminar  
- Outputs or screenshots (if required)  
- A reflection explaining what I completed and learned  

All reflections are also collected in `seminar.txt`.
