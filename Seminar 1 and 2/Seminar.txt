CIA Triad Connection (Brief)
In data science, Confidentiality is critical when handling personal or sensitive datasets, Integrity ensures models are trained on accurate data, and Availability ensures data pipelines and analytics systems remain accessible.


Joint Reflection and Final Summary
After comparing our chosen career paths and skills gap analyses, we found that although our target roles differ slightly, we share many of the same development needs. Both of us identified Python programming, SQL proficiency, and stronger data visualisation skills as key areas for improvement. We also recognised that practical experience such as working with real datasets, completing online courses, and developing small projects would help us build confidence and demonstrate ability to employers. Through discussion, we each identified a unique strength the other brings, such as strong communication skills or analytical thinking, which could help us stand out in competitive data science roles. The conversation gave us a clearer understanding of our readiness for the job market and how university modules, workshops, and extracurricular activities can support our progress.
This seminar also reinforced how structured reflection and peer discussion can help us understand industry expectations and identify realistic next steps. Overall, the activity helped us refine our development plans and strengthen our confidence in working toward our target careers.

Additional Reflection:
This exercise highlighted how data science skills increasingly intersect with cybersecurity, particularly in areas such as fraud detection, risk analysis, and secure data handling. Understanding confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a practical career context helped reinforce the importance of ethical data use and secure system design within analytical roles.
