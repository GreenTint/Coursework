This seminar helped me understand how malware can be identified and contained without executing malicious code by using static and behavioural indicators. Implementing file integrity checking and hash comparisons demonstrated how unauthorised modifications can be detected early, while signature-based scanning highlighted both the strengths and limitations of traditional antivirus methods. Simulating worm propagation reinforced the importance of layered defence strategies, combining host-based monitoring, network controls, and user awareness to reduce the impact of malware outbreaks.
