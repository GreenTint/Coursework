In this seminar, I ran Python scripts to perform ethical penetration testing activities within a controlled environment. I conducted passive reconnaissance to gather public domain information, simulated black-box web reconnaissance by inspecting HTTP headers, and performed basic port scanning on a local host. I also explored the use of Nmap through Python to identify open ports and running services, which helped me understand how reconnaissance and scanning fit into the overall penetration testing process.
