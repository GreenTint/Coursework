I used AI tools (ChatGPT) in an assistive role to support this assessment. The AI was used only to help with explaining concepts, clarifying instructions, improving the structure of my weekly reflections, and providing guidance on how to organise the portfolio. All practical work, coding tasks, execution of scripts, and reflections were completed and validated by me. No AI-generated content has been submitted without my own verification, editing, or understanding. The final work represents my own learning and practical engagement with the module material.
