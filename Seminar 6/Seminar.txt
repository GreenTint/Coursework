In this seminar, I carried out a static malware analysis workflow on a safe Windows executable using Python. I installed the required tools, generated cryptographic hashes to identify the file, and extracted readable strings to identify potential indicators of compromise. I then inspected the PE file structure and imported functions to better understand the executable’s behaviour. Finally, I applied a simple YARA rule to detect basic patterns and combined these steps into a complete static triage process, improving my understanding of how static analysis techniques are used in real-world malware analysis.
