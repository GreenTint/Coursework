This seminar demonstrated why authentication systems must be designed as a layered defence rather than relying on passwords alone. Implementing password strength checks, secure hashing with bcrypt, and salting techniques showed how poor design choices can directly enable attacks such as brute force and rainbow table cracking. The use of TOTP-based two-factor authentication highlighted how combining multiple authentication factors significantly improves system security, particularly in protecting confidentiality and integrity when credentials are compromised.
